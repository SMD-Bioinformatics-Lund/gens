# User guide

Gens consists of a sample page, listing all available samples, and a viewer where tracks can be inspected.

Inside the viewer, the user can either view multiple tracks for a single chromosome at a time - the "track view"

In band tracks, the individual tracks can be clicked, opening the "band context view" as a side menu.

The user can also view coverage for all chromosomes - the "chromosome view".

There are various settings that can be configured. Most are gathered under "settings view". Some track-specific settings can be found by clicking the track labels.

Additional meta data for the case can be seen in the meta data page.
