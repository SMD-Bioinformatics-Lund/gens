# Project overview

Brief introduction to Gens and the purpose of the project.

## Features

Gens visualizes copy number profiles together with B-allele frequencies, annotated genes and any additional tracks
you wish to include. It can also show externally generated data such as runs of homozygosity or UPD calls.

Combining these tracks makes it possible to inspect a wide range of structural chromosome abnormalities.
