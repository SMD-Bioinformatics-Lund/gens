## Overview

User settings can be configured in two locations. In the settings menu (cog wheel up to the right) and the track settings (click the track name).

Opening settings and track settings.

## Showing and hiding tracks

Tracks can be hidden through the track menu and in the settings menu. They can be shown again through the settings menu.

## Reordering tracks

Tracks can be reordered by dragging in the left Y-axis area (gray boxes). They can also be reordered by clicking the arrow buttons in the settings page.

## Collapsing tracks and changing track heights

Dot tracks have one height for when collapsed and one for when expanded. 

When band tracks are expanded, they will expand as much as needed to contain all layers of bands.

## Selecting multiple annotations

Multiple annotations can be selected.

## Navigating to highlights

Highlights can be added in the marker mode, toggled using the pencil button at the top (shortcut: M).

When added, they can quickly be navigated to using the arrow button next to the highlight in the settings menu.

## Highlight tracks by annotation

An annotation can be selected as a highlight, coloring corresponding ranges for other tracks.

## Add or remove a sample

Samples can be added and removed from the track view. Adding a new track will create new coverage and BAF tracks (and optionally variant and sample annotation tracks if available). These tracks are added at the bottom of the track list.

Removing a sample will remove all related tracks.
