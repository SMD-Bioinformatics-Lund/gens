Certain settings are persistant across refresh / switching cases (selected annotations and assigned track heights).

## Changing the Y-axis scale

The Y-axis scale can be adjusted for individual dot tracks through the track menu.

GIF

## Showing and hiding tracks

Tracks can be hidden through the track menu and in the settings menu. They can be shown again through the settings menu.

GIF

## Moving tracks

Tracks can be reordered by dragging in the left Y-axis area (gray boxes). They can also be reordered by clicking the arrow buttons in the settings page.

GIF

## Highlight tracks by annotation

The track backgrounds can be colored based on one of the annotation tracks.

GIF

## Collapsing tracks and changing track heights

Dot tracks and band tracks have different default settings. Dot tracks have one height for when collapsed and one for when expanded. When band tracks are expanded, they will expand as much as needed to contain all layers of bands.

GIF

## Add or remove a sample

Samples can be added and removed from the track view. Adding a new track will create new coverage and BAF tracks (and optionally variant and sample annotation tracks if available). These tracks are added at the bottom of the track list.

Removing a sample will remove all related tracks.
