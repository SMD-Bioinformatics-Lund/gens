Steps to setup a new work PR

(Can parts of this be automated?)

* Create a new branch
* Add a first draft text in CHANGELOG
* Commit, push to GitHub and create a PR against `dev`
* Also push to Jakob37/GitHub (for Codex access)
* Push latest dev version to Jakob37/GitHub as well
* Open a draft PR on GitHub
* Add a reference to this PR in the CHANGELOG (\[ID\]\(URL\) format)
* Open a draft PR on Jakob37/GitHub
* Copy in the `docs/work_pr_template.md`
* Fill it out
    - Link the Codex review URL to PR on Jakob37/GitHub
    - Add issues that would be closed
    - Write out what manual tests should be performed
