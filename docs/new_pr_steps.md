Steps to setup a new work PR

(Can parts of this be automated?)

1. Create a new branch
2. Add a first draft text in CHANGELOG
3. Commit, push to GitHub and create a PR against `dev`
4. Also push to Jakob37/GitHub (for Codex access)
5. Open a draft PR on GitHub
6. Open a draft PR on Jakob37/GitHub
7. Copy in the `docs/work_pr_template.md`
8. Fill it out
    - Link the Codex review URL to PR on Jakob37/GitHub
    - Add issues that would be closed
    - Write out what manual tests should be performed
